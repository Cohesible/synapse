### Problem
-->
<!-- 
A clear and concise description of the problem. 
Screenshots (without sensitive info!) are optional but greatly appreciated when the problem relates to UI. 

Be ready to answer clarifying questions from maintainers.

Ex. I don't know what will be deployed when using `run`
-->


### Suggestion
<!--
A suggested change and/or addition. Feel free to add more than one, potentially highlighting the ones you feel would be most impactful.
Suggestions can be as simple as referencing a solution other tools have, a totally fresh idea, or somewhere in between.

Don't worry about technical details unless it's relevant to your suggestion.

Ex. Show something similar to `deploy --dry-run` when prompted to deploy during `run`
