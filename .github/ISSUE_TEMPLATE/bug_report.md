A clear and concise description of the problem. 
Screenshots (without sensitive info!) are optional but greatly appreciated when the problem relates to UI. 

Be ready to answer clarifying questions from maintainers.

If you're able to semi-reliably reproduce this issue, include the steps (CLI commands, file edits, etc.) taken to hit the bug. Incomplete steps or rough guidance are OK!

Ex.
1. `synapse init`
2. `synapse deploy`
3. `synapse run ./main.ts` 

Ex.
It sometimes happens after I change the code and run `deploy`.
