// TODO:
// 1. Automatically check for updates (in the background, forked proc)
// 2. Auto-update is ok for the global install, for projects users should be aware that we're updating
//      * Initial release won't have per-project installs
// 3. This can fetch GitHub releases directly. No need for our own service.
